winshell
========

The winshell module is a light wrapper around the Windows shell functionality.

It includes convenience functions for accessing special folders, for using
the shell's file copy, rename & delete functionality, and a certain amount
of support for structured storage.

winshell is tested on all versions of Python from 2.4 to 3.2 (2.5+ for context
management).
